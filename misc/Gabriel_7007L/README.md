# Gabrielle 7007L Typewriter

I found this beautiful Gabrielle 7007L typewriter with nicely thick, largely MX compatible Cherry profile dye-sub keycaps in Danish.

It has Cherry MY switches. The stablized keycaps ones have these white adapters for the switch-mounted stabilizer pins. The adapters sit in MX plus shape mounts in the keycaps.

If I could replace the switches, I might take this part and wire it to an MCU, but the MY switches are simply too lousy for it to be worth the effort.
