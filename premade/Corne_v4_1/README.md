An AliExpress Corne 4.1 build with minimal black keycaps. I used linear MMD Ice Cream v4 switches.

I tried tactile AKKO Cream Purple Pros in it, but fwlt that it became quite noisy with those. The bit of foam that the case admitted didn't help enough. Maybe I should try filling it with adhesive putty next time.
