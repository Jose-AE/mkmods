## Keycaps
![C-stock PBT dye-sub from KBnordic](https://kbnordic.eu/keycaps/c-stock-wob-keycaps-pbt-dye-sub-iso-ansi-nordic-kbnordic.html). I like them a lot, and have had no issue with the c-stockness on any builds (this is my third set).

They must be modified to
 - clear the trackpoint, and
 - accommodate the 0.8u arrow key cluster.

## Keymap and programmability
As I now use something else as my daily driver, the keymap is very standard, so I can recall what's on it. The board has to be remapped using the ![TEX web configurator](https://program.tex.com.tw/shura/#layout), which I think negatively impacts its capabilities, usefulness and longevity. I hope they transition to QMK for future boards.
