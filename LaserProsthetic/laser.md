# Laser Prosthetic

This board's name pays homage to the line of trackpoint boards from [TEX](tex.com.tw/) that got me into mechanical keyboards, and the build log from [golem.hu](https://golem.hu) of the [Steel Tormentor](https://golem.hu/build-log/build-the-storm/) and it's cardboard prototype that got me into ergos and building myself.

The board is build of laser-cut 3mm MDF and 1,5mm acrylic, and drawn in Inkscape, following tips found on [golem.hu](https://golem.hu).

**Importantly,** if you want to use the files included in `drawings` to cut for yourself, then the plate is drawn with 13,5mm holes, not 14mm, which fits Cherry MX switches. *On the laser I used, with the acrylic I used,* MX switches fit perfectly---but you should **make your own tests!**

The screw holes are for M2 screws.

The `/drawings` directory contains the design `.svg`, and the files from which the board was cut. If nothing shows when you open them, then in Inkscape, do: `View > Display Mode > Visible Hairlines`.

I hope to update this to a proper build log soon.
