# Mechanical Keyboard Mods

My hope is to here publish my notes on the various mechanical keyboards I have modded one way or another.

- [Laser Prosthetic: Trackpoint ergo laser-cut from acrylic and MDF](LaserProsthetic/Laser.md)
- [Anne Pro 2: Hotswap mod using cheap rivets](AnnePro2/RivetHotswap.md)
