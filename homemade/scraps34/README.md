# Scraps34: Repurposing a TKL plate to build a split columnar

I managed to destroy the chip on an Xtrfy K4 with a pair of tweezers while porting it to SonixQMK. Note to self: Do a bootloader button first thing :D

The plate on that board is 1,5mm thick, so switches sit well in it. So what should I use it for? Handwire a TKL? Do a macropad? Uhh, a columnar, staggered macropad maybe? The next thought was a split, so here we are.

A commenter on this [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ErgoMechKeyboards/comments/1hmsck2/cheapest_split_kb_option_just_saw_a_tkl/) mentioned that "[there was a similar, quite influential build by Oobly in 2013](https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=49721.0)". That build is way cooler!

I've since drawn the used keys up using [Keyboard Layout Editor](https://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/):

Get the hacksaw, saw the plate over the kitchen sink:

Get some thick wire from the wall of the apartment I was renovating at the time:

Ignoring insulation for now, solder hotswap sockets, diodes, thick wire for columns, thin mutable hobby-wire for rows:

I split an old ethernet cable for its wires, and wired the two halves to a ProMicro. I used something that big because I wanted enough pins for a joystick.

I then insulated the matrix used some of my daugthers cheap acrylic paint. It's plastic-based.
